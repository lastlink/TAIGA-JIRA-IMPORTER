# (In DEVELOPMENT)
# Jira Taiga Importer: BETA
* V:0.10 (now stable and functional for loading into taiga pending cleanup)

##Description:
* Goal is to build a parser that will convert jira xml to taiga json format and a parser that does that opposite.

###Technologies
* Software Project Management Platforms
    * JIRA (xml database of all projects supports json import)
    * Taiga (json database for each project)
* Parser program 
    * Python element tree (having issues I think it's because of emoticons in the jira xml)
    * Ruby default for now
        * nokogiri ruby xml reader (PROGRESS)
    * Pearl - heard good for parsing may build one as well


###Features
* Export each JIRA project as a separate json project in TAIGA FORMATTING

###Taiga json notes:
* [Source](https://tree.taiga.io/project/last_link-taiga-jira-importer/) this may become invalid when project with project being reimported
* Owner is left blank unless email in taiga database
