# (In DEVELOPMENT)
# Jira Taiga Importer: BETA
* V:0.10 (now stable and functional for loading into taiga pending cleanup)

##Description:
* Goal is to build a parser that will convert jira xml to taiga json format and a parser that does that opposite.

##Instructions:
* Copy latest backup xml files from C:\Program Files\Atlassian\Application Data\JIRA\export
    * These will be entities.xml & activeobjects.xml in the most recent zip file. It is possible to force a backup from the admin daskboard e.g. http://jiraurl/secure/admin/XmlBackup.jspa
    * Copy these into the jira_xml_databases folder
* Make sure to have ruby installed on the computer and to gem install the dependencies
    * gem install 
        * nokogiri # provides support for xpath queries
        * iconv # used for cleaning bad control characters
        * json # used to export to json
        * date
* Cd into the project
    * ruby jiraparser.rb 

###Technologies
* Software Project Management Platforms
    * JIRA (xml database of all projects supports json import)
    * Taiga (json database for each project)
* Parser program 
    * Python element tree (having issues I think it's because of emoticons in the jira xml)
    * Ruby DEFAULT for now
        * nokogiri ruby xml reader 
            * Works great for xml b/c if invalid characters aka emoticons will read until that point
            * now that I have the query mappings done I can easily port to the others
    * Pearl - heard good for parsing may build one as well


###Features
* Export each JIRA project as a separate json project in TAIGA FORMATTING

###Taiga json notes:
* [Source](https://tree.taiga.io/project/last_link-taiga-jira-importer/) this may become invalid when project with project being reimported
* Owner is left blank unless email in taiga database
* Logo is saved as img text file
* Uses default jira values, may tweak to inlude your own custom ones
* Jira tasks are treated as stories
* Priority is only used for bug issues
* Any only sub tasks for Tasks and stories are imported any others are ignored
* Ordering of tasks may be somewhat randomized by when created
* Sprints have stories successfully linked
* Epics have tasks successfully linked
* Tags/Labels are supported
* Default for projects converts are to be not private since taiga only allows one private per free account
* Kanban also disabled by default may enable if desired

###Jira xml notes
* project id is 24

###Xml Resources:
* [W3 schools](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp)

####Not Supported:
* [ ] Logos saved in some string 64 format
* [x] History ignored (could be done, but just letting taiga auto generated everything as it's imported)

####Supported:
* [x] Export Project names
* [x] Export json
* [x] Taiga valid json imports properly and history is regenerated by user that imported
* [x] User ignored for user importing
* [x] sprints/milestones, userstories, subtasks, and tasks Supported
* [x] Epics 
* [x] Issues - only bugs
* [ ] Cleaup code
* [ ] generate json files for each project in xml database (right now done manually by name given)
* [ ] make milestone dynamic right now sprint story board namespace is hard coded in
